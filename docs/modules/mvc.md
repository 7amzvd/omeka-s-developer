title: MVC

Omeka S uses Zend Framework's [MVC layer](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/)
to coordinate between its data, program logic, and presentation components. For
an introduction and detailed reference to the MVC layer, please read Zend Framework's
[documentation](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/intro/). The [Quick Start](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/quick-start/)
guide is particularly helpful because it demonstrates how to do the following:

- Set up your view manager and controller configurations
- Create your controllers
- Create your view scripts
- Bring it all together by creating your routes

You can follow those directions as well as the [directions we provide](index.md)
to create your own Omeka S module.
