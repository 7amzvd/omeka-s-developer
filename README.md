# omeka-s-developer
Documentation for Omeka S developers

Like Omeka S itself, a work in progress.

## Contributing
The documentation is built with [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) from the markdown files here. Install mkdocs, then run `mkdocs build` in the directory you clone the files into. A build will be created in the `sites` directory of your clone.
